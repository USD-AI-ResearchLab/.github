# Collaborate

## Our Vision for Collaboration
We believe that great advances in AI and data science emerge when diverse minds come together.  
Through collaboration, we aim to accelerate innovation in foundational AI, sustainable computing,  
and real-world deployment.

## Areas of Interest
- Explainable / interpretable AI  
- Green / sustainable computing and energy-efficient models  
- Robustness, adversarial defenses, AI safety  
- Computer vision, pattern recognition, image & signal processing  
- Health informatics, medical imaging, biometrics  
- IoT, edge intelligence, and real-time systems  
- Cross-disciplinary AI applications (e.g. social good, environment, policy)

## What We Offer
- **Access to compute & infrastructure** (GPU/TPU clusters, high performance compute)  
- **Research data & shared datasets** (where permissible)  
- **Joint publications & co-authorship**  
- **Intellectual exchange & workshops**  
- **Mentorship & student involvement** (internships, thesis advising)  
- **Grant support & funding coupling**

## What We Look for in Collaborators
- University research groups (faculty, labs, departments)  
- Industry partners (in AI, health tech, IoT, sustainability)  
- Nonprofits / public sector agencies (applied AI, social impact)  
- Graduate students, postdocs, and visiting scholars  
- Startups & entrepreneurs interested in cutting-edge AI

## Collaboration Models
1. **Joint Research Projects** ‚Äî both parties contribute methods, experiments, and funding  
2. **Internship / Student Exchanges** ‚Äî students from partner institutions conduct research in our lab  
3. **Workshops / Symposiums** ‚Äî co-hosting thematic events  
4. **Visiting Scholars / Fellowships** ‚Äî short or long stays  
5. **Industry-Academic Partnerships** ‚Äî productization, prototypes, or pilot deployments  

## How to Get Started
1. Prepare a short proposal (~1‚Äì2 pages) outlining:  
   - Your team & background  
   - Objectives & research questions  
   - Proposed deliverables (papers, prototypes, software)  
   - Resource needs (compute, data, funding)  
   - Timeline & roles  
2. Send your proposal and CVs to: **collaborate@[yourdomain].org**  
3. We‚Äôll review within 2‚Äì4 weeks and schedule a kickoff call
