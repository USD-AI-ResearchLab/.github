<!--### Research Overview
We design **reliable, transparent, and deployable AI** by pairing solid theory with field-tested engineering. Our work spans core ML and domain problems in health, environment, and mobility—always with **ethics** and **reproducibility** at the core.

--- ### Key Areas (pillars)
- **Trustworthy & Ethical AI** — interpretability, robustness, bias mitigation, rigorous evaluation.  
- **Representation & Multimodal Learning** — text, vision, geospatial, **hyperspectral**, time-series.  
- **ML Systems & Data Engineering** — scalable pipelines (batch/streaming), lakehouse, MLOps.  
- **Applied AI** — clinical early-warning, remote sensing for ecology/climate, urban mobility.

### Expertise (how we work)
- **Methods:** self-supervision, graph learning, causal inference, probabilistic modeling.  
- **Tooling:** Python/SQL, PyTorch/JAX, Spark/Databricks, Snowflake/Delta, Airflow/Prefect, Docker.  
- **Standards:** dataset cards, model cards, CI/CD for data & models, governance & documentation.

## Featured Projects *(preview)*
**Purpose:** Showcase active research and technical capabilities with concise, actionable links.

Each project uses a standard template (README, data card, model card, license, `CITATION.cff`) and includes a two-sentence pitch + GitHub link.

- **Hyperspectral Earth** — Robust embeddings for NEON/remote sensing to detect subtle ecological change.  
  *Method:* contrastive pretraining + domain adaptation; reproducible notebooks. *(See `projects.md`.)*

- **Urban Signals** — Real-time mobility forecasting with streaming pipelines (Kafka → Spark) and GNNs.  
  *Method:* feature stores + model monitoring for drift. *(See `projects.md`.)*

- **Clinical Early-Warning** — Interpretable time-series models with calibrated uncertainty.  
  *Method:* causal features + conformal prediction. *(See `projects.md`.)*

See the growing catalog → [`projects.md`](./projects.md)

## Join or Collaborate
**Purpose:** Convert interest into action via clear pathways.

### Opportunities
- **Students** — Undergraduate, Masters, PhD (include CV, links to code, and a 1-page research statement). Openings and expectations live in `people.md` → **Open Roles**.  
- **Postdocs** — Rolling consideration for candidates aligned with our pillars.  
- **Industry/Public Sector** — Sponsored research, dataset partnerships, technology transfer.

### How to Reach Us
- **Email:** collaborate@usd.edu *(replace with your inbox)*  
- **Interest Form:** https://github.com/USD-AI-ResearchLab *(until a dedicated page is live, open an Issue with label `collaboration`)*  
- **Office Hours:** Monthly virtual Q&A (see **Issues** with label `office-hours`).

> Proposals with open data/sharing plans and clear societal impact receive priority.
